# Supabase adapter

This directory contains local Supabase configuration, declarative schemas, generated migrations, functions and tests.

Database definitions belong in `schemas/`. With the current pg-delta workflow, generate versioned migrations with `supabase db schema declarative sync -f <description> --no-apply`, review the output, then apply and verify it against a local database before any remote change. Check the installed CLI version and command help first.

Supabase remains an interchangeable adapter behind provider-neutral contracts. `auth.users` is the identity source; public profile or application tables must use RLS and ownership-aware policies.
